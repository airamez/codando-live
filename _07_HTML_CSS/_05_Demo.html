      <h1>About the Course</h1>
      <p>The objective of this course is to provide free education to all Brazilians interested in learning
        computer programming ("Software Engineering"), offering content and quality comparable to good university
        courses.</p>
      <p>The content focuses on fundamentals and practical aspects. The idea is to create a dynamic course with hands-on
        exercises,
        demonstrations, and explanations that help in understanding the material and clarifying the WHY behind concepts.
      </p>
      <p>As with any course, it's essential that you do your part and put in the effort to follow along, especially by
        completing the
        exercises.</p>
      <p>Classes will be conducted via live videos on YouTube, but if you are just starting, focus on watching the
        existing content. To follow the current lessons, a solid understanding of all previously covered material is
        necessary.
        So, don't rush, but stay dedicated and maintain continuous effort. Becoming a junior programmer requires several
        thousand hours
        of dedication.</p>
      <p>This course will cover all the necessary content to prepare you to become a programmer and secure a place in
        this
        vast and opportunity-rich market.</p>
      <p>Below is a table listing all the lessons with links to the videos and files.</p>
